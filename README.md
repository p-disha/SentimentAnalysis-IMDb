# SentimentAnalysis-IMDb
 
 In this project I worked with basic sentiment analysis, and built a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. I used IMDB data set a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification. I worked on the project by dividing it into 9 small tasks, recieving an accuracy of ~90%(89.9% test accuracy).
Software Pre requisites: Python, Jupyter and sci-kit learn
